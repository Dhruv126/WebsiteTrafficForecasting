# Project Summary: Website Traffic Forecasting

## 1. Introduction

This project was designed to develop a robust forecasting model for daily website traffic. The primary objectives were to improve forecasting accuracy, optimize resource allocation, and support enhanced decision-making for content and marketing strategies.

## 2. Data Overview

The dataset includes historical website traffic information with the following key columns:
- **Row:** Index of the data point.
- **Day:** Day of the week (e.g., Sunday, Monday).
- **Day.Of.Week:** Numeric representation of the day (1 for Sunday through 7 for Saturday).
- **Date:** The full date of the traffic data.
- **Page.Loads:** Number of page loads (target variable).
- **Unique.Visits:** Number of unique visitors.
- **First.Time.Visits:** Number of first-time visitors.
- **Returning.Visits:** Number of returning visitors.

## 3. Methodology

### Data Preprocessing & EDA
- **Data Cleaning:** Converted date strings to datetime objects and removed commas from numeric fields.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed statistical summaries and visualized trends to understand seasonality and patterns.

### Feature Engineering
- Created time-based features (Year, Month, Week, Day, Day_Of_Week, Is_Weekend).
- Engineered lag features (Lag_1 and Lag_7) and a 7-day rolling mean to capture temporal dependencies.

### Modeling Approaches
Two primary forecasting models were built:
1. **ARIMA Model (Time Series Approach):**
   - Evaluated using RMSE and MAPE.
   - **Performance:** RMSE = 1562.26, MAPE = 29.90%
2. **Random Forest Model (Machine Learning Approach):**
   - Tuned with GridSearchCV.
   - **Performance:** RMSE = 299.46, MAPE = 5.95%
3. **Hybrid Model:**
   - Combined forecasts from ARIMA and Random Forest.
   - **Performance:** RMSE = 702.84, MAPE = 13.47%

### Model Evaluation
Evaluation was performed using:
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**

The results demonstrated that the Random Forest model outperformed the ARIMA model on its own. The hybrid model provided a balanced forecast but did not surpass the performance of the tuned Random Forest model.

## 4. Key Findings

- **Feature Engineering Impact:**  
  Time-based features and lag/rolling statistics significantly improved the forecasting capability.
  
- **Model Performance:**  
  The tuned Random Forest model achieved the best performance with an RMSE of 299.46 and a MAPE of 5.95%, indicating high accuracy in forecasting website traffic.
  
- **Hybrid Approach:**  
  Although the hybrid model did not outperform the Random Forest model, combining different approaches can be beneficial when aiming to capture varied data patterns.

## 5. Recommendations & Future Work

- **Model Enhancements:**  
  Further tuning and exploration of advanced models (e.g., Prophet, XGBoost) could potentially improve forecast accuracy.
  
- **Real-Time Forecasting:**  
  Developing a real-time forecasting pipeline and deploying the model as a web service or dashboard for continuous monitoring.
  
- **Extended Analysis:**  
  Incorporating external factors (e.g., marketing campaigns, holidays) may further enhance forecast performance.

## 6. Conclusion

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to website traffic forecasting using both time series and machine learning methods. With robust feature engineering and model evaluation, the Random Forest model showed superior performance. Future enhancements and real-time deployment can help maintain accurate traffic forecasts for better resource planning and decision-making.
